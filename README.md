## Where are your projects?

My focus for the past few years has been school and work. I could upload some assignments I'm particularly proud of--it's just a matter of figuring out which ones I think would be worth sharing. Why haven't I done this already? No idea.

Unfortunately, I cannot showcase work from my most recent job without permission from our customers. This has been where most of my attention for development has gone, so I don't have many other projects to share.

If you want to go WAAAY back, you can check out some of my old projects on Khan Academy. They're made with JavaScript (ECMAScript 5) and ProcessingJS. I had less concern for clean code back then, but the results are certainly cool!
